Leaving for mel tomorrow. It is gonna be a new trip,right? 
My parents are leaving for mel next months, what is going to happen? Heaven knows.
Just a little worried about my future, what is it going to look like?
Cleaning up house, doing part time job, reviewing courses and setting up my plan.
Got a lot of stuff to deal with. Make me busy and make me peaceful.
